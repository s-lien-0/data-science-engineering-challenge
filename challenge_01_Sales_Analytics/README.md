# Challenge 1: Sales Data Analysis

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to practice **data analysis** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with a real-world dataset. We will analyze a supermarket sales dataset to understand key metrics and trends that can provide insights into store performance.

## Task

Your task is to analyze a dataset containing sales data for a supermarket. Specifically, you will:

1. Determine which **product lines generate the most revenue**.
2. Explore whether **gender** plays a role in spending patterns.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this challenge is the **Supermarket Sales Dataset**. It includes information about sales transactions, including the **branch**, **product line**, **quantity sold**, **price**, and **customer demographics**.

- [Download Supermarket Sales Dataset (CSV)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/supermarket_sales.csv)

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Invoice ID**: Unique identifier for each sale transaction.
- **Branch**: Store branch where the transaction occurred.
- **City**: The city where the branch is located.
- **Customer type**: Regular or Member.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Product line**: Type of product sold (e.g., Electronic, Food, Clothing).
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased.
- **Unit price**: Price per unit of the product.
- **Total**: Total amount spent on the transaction.
- **Date**: Date and time of the sale.

## Deliverables

- A Jupyter notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) containing:
  - Code to clean and analyze the data.
  - Visualizations (bar chart and pie chart).
  - Summary of insights from the analysis.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook** or any Python IDE for script execution.
