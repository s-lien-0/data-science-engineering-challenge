# ðŸ©º Hospital Visit Summary

**Insight 1:**  
General Medicine, Cardiology, and Orthopaedics account for the highest total visit costs across the year.

**Insight 2:**  
Males and females incur similar total costs overall, suggesting gender-balanced service use.
However, patients aged 18â€“55 contribute the most to total cost â€” primarily due to higher visit volume and higher cost per visit.
 
**Insight 3:**  
The highest total monthly costs were recorded in March, June, and November.
These spikes are likely related to seasonal illnesses (e.g., flu, respiratory cases) and may justify increased seasonal staffing or awareness campaigns in those periods.
