# Data Analysis & Engineering Challenges

This repository features a collection of standalone tasks and small-scale projects centered around data analysis and engineering workflows. Each entry includes a dataset, a business-style prompt, and a complete solution implemented in Python.

---

## Purpose

The aim is to develop a well-structured, practical archive of real-world data challenges with a focus on:

- Working with raw and semi-structured data
- Exploring, cleaning, and transforming datasets
- Building lightweight ETL pipelines and summary reports
- Applying Python, SQL, and common data libraries
- Practicing reproducible, maintainable analysis

---

## Repository Structure

- Each folder is numbered sequentially: `challenge_01`, `challenge_02`, etc.
- Each folder contains:
  - A **task prompt** (realistic business scenario)
  - A **dataset** or external data source
  - One or more **scripts** or notebooks with the solution
  - A brief `README.md` summarizing approach and key outputs

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sqlite3`)
- SQL (via SQLite or DuckDB)
- File formats: CSV, JSON
- ETL and scripting patterns
- Planned: APIs, workflow orchestration, deployment tools
